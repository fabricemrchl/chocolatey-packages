<description>
FPS Monitor tracks your PC's hardware state and displays this information as an overlay in-game. You no longer need to switch to desktop or attach a second display to control your hardware status. FPS Monitor will show all valuable information in-game.

FPS Monitor is the very first special software tool that not only shows an FPS counter similar to good old Fraps™, but can also display a lot of other parameters. This gives a clear overview of how your hardware is performing while you're gaming.

FPS Monitor does not require configuration and displays all the most useful information immediately after installation, as well as has a rich functionality for those who prefer to configure everything as he likes.
