    <summary>An Open Source YouTube app for privacy.</summary>
    <description>FreeTube is an open source desktop YouTube player built with privacy in mind. Use YouTube without advertisements and prevent Google from tracking you with their cookies and JavaScript. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux thanks to Electron.

Please note that FreeTube is currently in Beta. While it should work well for most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be addressed.

## How does it work ?
FreeTube uses the Invidious API to grab and serve videos. Invidious scrapes the YouTube site which prevents the need for any official YouTube API. While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions, history, and saved videos are stored locally on your computer and never sent out. Using a VPN or Tor is recommended to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

## Features
* Watch videos without ads
* Use YouTube without Google tracking you using cookies and JavaScript
* Tor / Proxy Support
* Subscribe to channels without an account
* Local subscriptions, history, and saved videos
* Export and import subscriptions
* Open videos from your browser directly into FreeTube (with extension)
* Mini Player
* Light / dark theme
